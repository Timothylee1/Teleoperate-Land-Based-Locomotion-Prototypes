# Teleoperate Land-Based Locomotion Prototypes
Singapore Institute of Technology, Robotics Systems Engineering; Project 1 AY21/22

EE-6 to EE-10 are a series of codes which are a progressive elaboration to the creation of teleoperated land-based locomotion protoypes, Lite Kit and Production Kit.

Programming language used: Propeller Spin

Files used includes libraries from Parallax, Professor Kenichi, and other sources (located in individual file header documentation).

EE-6 consists of motor control for the Lite Kit.

EE-7 includes motor control, sensor control, and MyLiteKit for the Lite Kit.

EE-8 encompass motor control, sensor control, MyLiteKit, and comm control for Lite Kit. 

EE-9 comprise encapsulation of the aforementioned control object files in MyLiteKit for behavioural control.

EE-10 is similar to EE-6-9, where the Lite Kit is programmed and able to perform the tasks of the previous sections. Certain components are to be integrated into the Production Kit to facilitate use of EE-10's code to run the Production Kit.

Final is similar to EE-10, except that it is altered according to certain conditions regarding the Production Kit.
